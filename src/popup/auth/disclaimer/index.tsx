        1. The Alpha 0.1 Sonar Wallet is still under security auditing
        processes. Kindly DO NOT import wallets with significant funds. The aim
        of this stage of development is simply for testing new wallets, and
        importing wallets with test funds. Sonar is NOT RESPONSIBLE for any
        exploits that may happen at this stage.

        2. DO NOT SHARE the build with anyone. We want to limit any access to
        our code from third parties and sharing the build with everyone poses a
        risk to your investment.

        3. Until the Sonar Wallet is uploaded on appstores in the near future,
        any updates will be presented to you in the form of Builds like the one
        below. Every time there is a new updated build, you will have to
        delete/remove the previous build and replace with the new version.
